## About the Development Process

This Flutter Utility App was developed through a collaborative process:

1. Initial code and feature ideas were generated by Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic.
2. Kyle Romero integrated the AI-generated code, made necessary adjustments, and ensured the app's functionality across different platforms.
3. The iterative development process involved multiple rounds of feedback and refinement between Kyle and Claude.

This approach showcases the potential of human-AI collaboration in software development, combining the strengths of AI in code generation and problem-solving with human expertise in integration, testing, and real-world application.
